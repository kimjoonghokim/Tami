# Tami: the Temperature And Mask Imaging solution!

Tami is Raspberry Pi based device designed to assist stores and businesses in safely reopening during the pandemic. She is meant to be posted at the entrances of physical storefronts to ensure that customers are only allowed to enter the store if they are following proper mask procedure and display no feverish symptoms. Tami utilizes a machine learning camera to detect face masks, and an IR thermal sensor array to detect temperatures of the incoming patrons.

Tami was designed and built by Joongho Kim, Elisa Dorn, and Jasmeet Mander for the Smart City Category of MakeUofT2021.

The mask detection aspect of the project was based from a tutorial posted by Caroline Dunn at TomsHardware- https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-face-mask-detector

## Software PreReqs:
Please ensure that your Raspberry Pi is installed with RaspberryOS
Please ensure that you have OpenCV, Tensorflow and CircuitPython installed


## Hardware Used:

* Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB (cooling fans optional)
* AMG8833 IR Thermal Sensor (Adafruit)
* 7-inch Touchscreen Display (Sunfounder)
* Pi Camera 2
* HDMI to Micro-HDMI cable
* USB-C Power Supply
* M3 Threaded Brass Inserts
* Assorted M3 screws
* Assorted Jumper wires 
* 3D Printer
* Soldering Iron

The soldering iron is used purely to set the threaded inserts into the printed parts, this is so that the threads will not strip and ensures that you will be able to repeatedly unscrew the hardware. Follow the technical sheet for the AMG8833 to wire it properly.
