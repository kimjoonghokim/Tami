# Tami: the Temperature And Mask Imaging solution!

Tami is Raspberry Pi based device designed to assist stores and businesses in safely reopening during the pandemic. She is meant to be posted at the entrances of physical storefronts to ensure that customers are only allowed to enter the store if they are following proper mask procedure and display no feverish symptoms. Tami utilizes a machine learning camera to detect face masks, and an IR thermal sensor array to detect temperatures of the incoming patrons.

Tami was designed and built by Joongho Kim, Elisa Dorn, and Jasmeet Mander for the Smart City Category of MakeUofT2021.
